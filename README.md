# FindSpot 
This application is my bachelor thesis project. FindSpot is a geolocation-based prototype app which allows users sharing their favorites outdoors "spots" between each other. This project was the first one made from the scratch. The app is written using Swift 4.0 and follows MVC pattern. UI was created in pure code without storyboard.
